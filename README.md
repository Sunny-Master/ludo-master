# Ludo Master

Ludo Master is based on Ludo, a classic board game enjoyed by many during their childhood, including myself. This game is designed for 2 to 4 players and is inspired by the traditional Indian game Pachisi. Ludo Master also has a Solo Player mode where you can play with computer as the 2nd player. 

## Game Overview
In Ludo, each player starts with four pieces in their home area. The objective is to move all four pieces from the starting area, around the cross-shaped board, and into the central "home" column. Players take turns rolling a die to determine their moves. Landing on a square occupied by an opponent's piece sends the opponent's piece back to the starting area.

As a fan of Ludo since childhood, I created this web-based version to bring the joy of the game to a digital screen with possibility of reaching out to a wider audience in future. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did growing up.
